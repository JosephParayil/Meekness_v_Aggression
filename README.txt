This repository contains all C++ source code files which I have used in my 9th grade Science Fair project:

"Natural Selection Revisited: Optimizing the Tradeoff in Meekness & Aggression"

I have uploaded this to Github so that anyone interested can view the source code files in digital form and compile and run it for themselves.

Abstract:
"This project shows how the distinction between meekness and aggression affects success among other meek and aggressive creatures. The difference presents a dilemma and knowing the difference is applicable in a diverse range of fields, such as evolutionary behavior and microeconomics. This project is based on coding a simulation in C++, which includes meek and aggressive “creatures” competing to reproduce more creatures of its type. The functionality in detail and the difference between meek and aggressive is explained later in the presentation. A history of the population of meek and aggressive creatures is outputted by the program, and is used to make a stacked area graph to interpret. Additionally, an average-of-all-trials graph is made to counter randomness. The data varied much, but from the average graph a clear pattern is visible. A rapid growth in aggressive creatures occurs early, but is slowed as the population reaches a ratio of about 2 meek to 3 aggressive. Even though aggressive creatures are slightly more populous, neither characteristic is truly the successful one. Also, it is important to note that the population size went down dramatically, in most cases more than halving. So, this project found that neither meekness nor aggression is truly favored by natural selection. Although this simulation is extremely simple compared to the complexity of the real world, general patterns in this simulation may be used to predict or describe behaviors in real-life environments and economies."
